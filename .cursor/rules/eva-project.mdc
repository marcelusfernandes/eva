Cursor Rules ‚Äì Plugin Development for UI Evaluation with Anthropic Claude (Figma)
Project Context
This is a Figma plugin that uses Anthropic's Claude API to analyze selected UI elements and return constructive feedback.

The goal is to assist designers with UX quality checks, content critiques, and accessibility hints‚Äîwithout replacing their judgment.

üìå General Guidelines
Always assume Figma‚Äôs API is being used in a plugin context.

Assume figma.currentPage.selection provides access to selected elements.

Keep plugin UI minimal. Feedback will appear in a floating side panel or annotations.

Use Claude Instant for speed or Claude Opus for higher-quality analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Development Rules
1. Plugin Setup
Use manifest.json compatible with Figma Plugin API v1.

The UI should load in an iframe panel using ui.html.
Backend logic should run in code.ts.
Listed links as the source of information to provide de analysis

2. Claude API Integration
Use Anthropic's REST API (via fetch) from the plugin.

Format prompts using a system message that defines UX critique style.

Chunk UI data (e.g., text content, button labels, font size, hierarchy) as JSON when sending.

3. DesignEvaluation Logic
Base evaluations on Visual design principles
